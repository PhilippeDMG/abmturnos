<h1>create</h1>
<p>this is the create page.</p>
<p><strong>Unlike traditional multi-page apps, navigating to /create and back updates the contents of the current page, like a single-page app. This gives us the best of both worlds â€” fast server-rendered startup, then instant navigation. (This behaviour can be configured.)</strong></p>
